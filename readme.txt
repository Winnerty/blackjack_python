This is Timofey Karpeev's Python course project (winter 2023/2024).

This is the Online Blackjack game 1 vs 1 (player vs dealer).

Here are the steps player should take:

1) You launch the python code
2) You enter you bet and press "New game"
3) Both you and dealer get their hands
4) You chose to "Stand on it" or to get "Additional card" and press "Confirm"
5) After you choose to "Stand on it", dealer opens his cards and game rather finishes or not.
6) If the game is not finished after step 5) you have to press "Dealer", because cards will not automatically add to
dealer's hand, it can be only done by the user (you). No worries, it knows when to stop :) If the game is not finished,
you have to press "Dealer" again and so on, until the game is finished.
7) If you are willing to play another game, change your bet or stay with the same one and press "New game" and so on (steps 3 - 7).

P.S. Do not try to fool the system by entering wrong bets or betting too much, I am watching you.
